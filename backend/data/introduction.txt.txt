Personal Background
Self-introduction / introduction — Hi, I’m Sriram Reddy, and I come from Peddapalli district in Telangana. Who am I? I’m someone passionate about tech and innovation. My father's name is K. Sampath Reddy, and my mother's name is Premalatha. I recently completed my B.Tech graduation from CMR Technical Campus, where I pursued Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. This summary of my background is a quick self-introduction and gives you a basic idea about myself. i born on 2022 may 25 age gender male

 Internship Experience
 My experience is how many years or months
This part of my introduction covers my professional training. I recently completed an internship at Dataspeaks for 6 months , where I worked as a Full Stack Developer. During this time, I handled frontend and backend work using ReactJS, Node.js, SpringJS, and MongoDB. This experience helped shape who I am as a developer. It was not just about coding — it was a learning journey that forms a key part of my self-introduction. If you're looking for a summary about myself, this internship reflects my learning and real-world exposure.

 Projects and Technical Skills
Let me give you a detailed self-introduction by talking about some of the projects I’ve worked on. One major project is Echo.AI, a MERN stack chat app with AI features powered by Google’s Gemini API — basically, an AI assistant like Meta AI in WhatsApp. Another project is a full-stack Instagram clone using Firebase. I also built a PDF Reader AI Assistant using Python, FAISS, LangChain, and LLMs — it lets users upload a PDF and ask context-based questions. These projects are a big part of who I am, and are a strong summary of my experience. So if you’re asking for an introduction or about myself, this is what defines me as a developer.

Interests and Hobbies
To make this self-introduction complete, I’ll talk a little about my personal interests. I love going to the gym, playing sports, and exploring new mobile games. These activities keep me energetic and focused. I also enjoy spending time on social media and learning about new technologies. This part of my introduction shows who I am outside of work — what I like, what I enjoy, and how I stay balanced. So if you’re asking about myself or want a quick summary, I’m a tech enthusiast who loves fitness, gaming, and growth.

 Strengths and Areas of Growth
Let me finish this introduction with my strengths and a bit of honesty about where I can improve. I learn fast, adapt quickly, and I enjoy solving problems. I take pride in being open to any new tech stack. One of my weaknesses is procrastination — I’m working on that every day. This self-introduction wouldn’t be complete without saying that I’m constantly growing. If you’re wondering who I am, I’m someone who stays motivated, learns quickly, and wants to keep improving. That’s a quick summary about myself and how I look at my personal and professional development.

What are you doing now or currently
Currently, I’m actively working on building my career in the fields of Machine Learning, AI Engineering, and Software Engineering. I’ve been dedicating my time to gaining deeper knowledge in areas such as LLMs, RAG pipelines, vector databases, and full-stack web development using the MERN stack. I’m also exploring practical applications by building end-to-end projects that integrate AI models with real-world problems. At this stage, I’m looking for job opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experienced teams, and grow professionally in any of these domains."


How to build this projest my voice assistance or how did you done this what you have used rag project 
To build this REHE project (Retrieval Enhanced Hybrid Embedding), I followed a structured and hands-on approach. I started by exploring the core components required for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, including document embedding, vector databases, and LLM-based querying. I used OpenAI’s embedding "Can you explain how REHE works in your system from start to finish" models to convert PDF and text documents into high-dimensional vectors and stored them using FAISS—an efficient similarity search library. For the language model and querying interface, I integrated OpenAI’s GPT models via API calls to generate meaningful and context-aware responses based on retrieved chunks. I used LangChain to experiment with prompt chaining, although I later shifted to a more lightweight and direct pipeline for better control and transparency. The backend was built using FastAPI, and I designed a minimal frontend using ReactJS to let users upload documents and ask questions interactively. The project was heavily supported by tools like ChatGPT, official documentation, and open-source tutorials. Anyone with a basic understanding of vector stores, embeddings, and LLM APIs can replicate this setup. And if you’d like to build this yourself or need guidance, you’re welcome to contact me directly—I’d be happy to help.
