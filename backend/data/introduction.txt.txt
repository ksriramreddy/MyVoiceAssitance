Personal Background
Self-introduction / introduction — Hi, I’m Sriram Reddy, and I come from Peddapalli district in Telangana. Who am I? I’m someone passionate about tech and innovation. My father's name is K. Sampath Reddy, and my mother's name is Premalatha. I recently completed my B.Tech graduation from CMR Technical Campus, where I pursued Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. This summary of my background is a quick self-introduction and gives you a basic idea about myself.

 Internship Experience
This part of my introduction covers my professional training. I recently completed an internship at Dataspeaks, where I worked as a Full Stack Developer. During this time, I handled frontend and backend work using ReactJS, Node.js, SpringJS, and MongoDB. This experience helped shape who I am as a developer. It was not just about coding — it was a learning journey that forms a key part of my self-introduction. If you're looking for a summary about myself, this internship reflects my learning and real-world exposure.

 Projects and Technical Skills
Let me give you a detailed self-introduction by talking about some of the projects I’ve worked on. One major project is Echo.AI, a MERN stack chat app with AI features powered by Google’s Gemini API — basically, an AI assistant like Meta AI in WhatsApp. Another project is a full-stack Instagram clone using Firebase. I also built a PDF Reader AI Assistant using Python, FAISS, LangChain, and LLMs — it lets users upload a PDF and ask context-based questions. These projects are a big part of who I am, and are a strong summary of my experience. So if you’re asking for an introduction or about myself, this is what defines me as a developer.

Interests and Hobbies
To make this self-introduction complete, I’ll talk a little about my personal interests. I love going to the gym, playing sports, and exploring new mobile games. These activities keep me energetic and focused. I also enjoy spending time on social media and learning about new technologies. This part of my introduction shows who I am outside of work — what I like, what I enjoy, and how I stay balanced. So if you’re asking about myself or want a quick summary, I’m a tech enthusiast who loves fitness, gaming, and growth.

 Strengths and Areas of Growth
Let me finish this introduction with my strengths and a bit of honesty about where I can improve. I learn fast, adapt quickly, and I enjoy solving problems. I take pride in being open to any new tech stack. One of my weaknesses is procrastination — I’m working on that every day. This self-introduction wouldn’t be complete without saying that I’m constantly growing. If you’re wondering who I am, I’m someone who stays motivated, learns quickly, and wants to keep improving. That’s a quick summary about myself and how I look at my personal and professional development.
